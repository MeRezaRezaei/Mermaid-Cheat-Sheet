    %% Explanation of the graph:
    %% 1. The graph direction is 'TD' (Top Down).
    %% 2. Nodes are connected using different types of edges:
    %%    - '-->' for normal arrows (e.g., A --> B)
    %%    - '==>' for thicker arrows (e.g., B ==> C)
    %%    - '--->' for dashed arrows (e.g., C ---> D)
    %%    - '-.->' for dotted arrows (e.g., D -.-> E)
    %%    - '---' for dashed lines (e.g., E --- F)
    %%    - '-->' with a label for labeled arrows (e.g., F -->|Label| G)
    %%    - '<-->' for bidirectional arrows (e.g., G <--> H)
    %%
    %% 3. The 'subgraph' keyword is used to group nodes A and B together in 'Group1'.
    %% 4. The graph can represent more complex structures with multiple connections and bidirectional relationships.
    %% 5. There are no strict flow paths. This is more of a network or relationship diagram.
