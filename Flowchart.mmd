flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Do something]
    B --> C{Is it good?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Continue]
    C -->|No| E[Fix it]
    E --> B
    D --> F[Finish]
    F --> G[End]

    %% Explanation of the flowchart:
    %% 1. The flowchart direction is 'TD' (Top Down).
    %% 2. Nodes represent specific steps in a process (e.g., Start, Do something, Finish).
    %% 3. The diamond shape (C) represents a decision point with two possible outcomes: 'Yes' and 'No'.
    %% 4. The edges ('-->' and '|Label|') indicate the flow between steps and conditions in the process.
    %% 5. Flowcharts are ideal for representing linear or branching processes with clear decision points.
    %% 6. The flowchart has a clear direction and defines steps in a specific sequence.
    %% 7. Unlike graphs, flowcharts are designed for step-by-step process visualization and decision-making.

    %% Key differences with graphs:
    %% - Flowcharts represent linear, sequential processes, while graphs show relationships between nodes.
    %% - Flowcharts usually include decision points (e.g., Yes/No), while graphs can have multiple bidirectional connections.
    %% - Flowcharts are more structured and follow a strict flow, whereas graphs are used for more general network relationships.
